# System Architecture 

-	Raspberry Pi 5: It uses ROS2 and handles more complex tasks like object and colour detection, route planning, and the 2D LiDAR
-	RP2040 (Pi Pico): Handles real-time tasks (motor PID, encoder feedback, servo control, IMU, 1D LiDAR)
-	LiDARs: Used for detecting turn direction, obstacles and in parking
-	IMU: Gives yaw (and other orientations) of the robot in [0,360)
-	Motor/Servos: PWM and PI controls respectively for movement using sensor data, coordinated by the RP2040

## Mobility

- A commercially available metal [chassis base](https://www.elecrow.com/4wd-smart-car-robot-chassis-for-arduino-servo-steering.html) has been used with custom designed and printed parts. This chassis was selected mainly for its good steering system, mobility and customisabilty (there are lots of through holes through the base-frame). While the steering was retained, the remaining parts were custom designed.
- A link based steering system is used in the robot with a link-rod between the front wheel joints and another between a wheel joint and the servo. This steering system has been taken from the chassis without much modification due to its precision. A MG996R 180° servo has been used for the steering due to its high torque and accuracy, which improve mobility. 
- A single axle rear drive train is used for driving is used. A 200RPM N20 motor is used due to its speed and decent torque. A 1:1 gear ratio is used with a pair of brass gears. Bearings are used on the rear axle for smooth movement. A custom [rear drive holder](https://github.com/pkr2308/Ctrl-Alt-Defeat-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025/blob/main/design-files/N20%20Motor%20Holder.stl) is used to house all these parts.
- Both the servo and N20 motors are connected to the peripherals board. The servo is controlled using the standard library, while PWM is used for speed control of the motor.
- Turning Radius: Optimized for narrow WRO track corners, and is 32-33 cm.
- Build Choice Reasoning: Offers realistic car-like dynamics, ideal for FE challenge simulation.
[Design files](https://github.com/pkr2308/Ctrl-Alt-Defeat-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025/tree/main/design-files) contains all the other custom 3D-Design files (created on [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com)) for mounting various compnents and systems onto the base chassis and one another.
[Robot assembly](https://github.com/pkr2308/Ctrl-Alt-Defeat-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025?tab=readme-ov-file#robot-assembly) instructions are below.
- Improvements: 
1. A uniform steering system. In the current model, the servo has to turn a greater angle left than right for the same angles of the wheels in each direction. This complicates driving algorithms to some extent. A better, but equally smooth steering system, maybe a rack-and-pinion, will solve these issues.
2. Better gear train. The current gears, though made of brass wear down quite easily for some unidentified reason. This causes slipping if there is more wear.
3. Reducing the turning radius. The current bot, while quite manoeuvrable has a large turn radius (almost 33-34cm). Reducing this would make taking tighter turns possible, improving error margins in the obstacle round. This can be done by bringing the drive train forward.

## Power

- A [Waveshare UPS Hat E](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/UPS_HAT_(E)) is used for powering the robot. It uses 4 4000mAH 3.6V 21700 Li-ion batteries. (Different battery capacities may be used). All outputs are at 5V.
- The Pi is powered at a stable 5V via the POGO pins on the UPS Hat. The PiCamera and RPLidar are power from the Pi.
- The RP2040 and all connected sensors are powered through a USB A-C cable from the Pi to it.
- The total current draw for the obstacle round is around 600-630mA, and around 250-300mA for idle with the Pi.
- The peripherals board gets power directly from the UPS Hat through a USB-A cable that has been cut to get the power wires. This powers only the rear motor and steering servo.
- Improvements:
1. The UPS Hat that we are using has a weird anomaly. Although the batteries will have good voltage output and detected capacity, it will show the net remaining capacity to be very low. We have edited the code of the UPS library to not allow it run `sudo poweroff` when it misdetects such a situation.
2. Maybe not have the small switch on the board; closing it will cause these 2 systems to be connected, which could lead to some bad outcomes!

## Sensors

- __TFLuna LiDAR:__ These are 1D-LiDARs that are used to measure distances to the front, left, right (for driving) and back(parking) of the robot. They are connected to the RP2040. A separate section has been designed at the front of the robot to house all four LiDARs. Each LiDAR has 5 wires, grouped into 4+1 (I2C + GND) going into the peripherals board. These LiDARs were selected for their accuracy, small size and ease of use.
- __BNO055:__ This is the IMU we are using for orientation due to its reliability, accuracy and simplicity of use. It is connected to the RP2040, and is directly slotted into the peripherals board.
- __nRF24L01:__ This is the wireless module used for wireless communication during testing and debugging with the RP2040. Another custom module (telemetry board) is made for receiving the data. (Note : This is not plugged in for actual rounds). It is directly slotted into the peripherals board.
- __Motor encoders:__ The encoders give ticks each time they are trigerred by rotation of the motor shaft. Data from it is used for distance calculations. In our case, about 43 ticks corresponds to 1cm. The 4 encoder wires are grouped together and connected to the peripherals board.
- __Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Wide:__ It is used with the Pi for detecting the an obstacles. The camera is secured at four points for greater stability. With only two connection points, the camera could be easily turned due to the material properties of the Camera to Pi 5 connection wire. The higher mounting location allows it to detect obstacles from a large distance (almost 2m!) and plan accordingly. The Wide lens allows for a greater field of view. The NoIR version used to give odd red patches due to the lack of the IR filter in some test cases.
- __RPLidar A1:__ It is a 2D-LiDAR. It was supposed to be connected to the Pi and give distance all around the robot. However, we could not get it work Raspbian or any other OS. (It worked well with ROS though!) So, it is basically dead weight!
- Improvements: 
1. The RPLidar doesn't work well with the standard Raspbian OS on the Pi or with a computer, with values for many angles returned zero or being frozen. It seems to work fine on ROS though. Not sure what the issue is, but resoving this can improve ease of programming.
2. The 1D LiDARs are quite expensive. Ultrasonic sensors would have done for the sides.
3. The BNO055 does clock stretching, which causes issues on the I2C buses of most microcontrollers (thankfully not the RP2040). It also has a slight drifting tendency of a few degrees after a round. A IMU that does not have these issues and is easy to use will be more accurate and more flexible in use.

The [Bill of Materials](https://github.com/pkr2308/Ctrl-Alt-Defeat-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025/blob/main/design-files/Bill%20of%20Materials.md) contains all necessary parts/components and their sources.

## Obstacle Management

- This is done mainly using the camera feed from the PiCamera 3 Wide. The NoIR version tends to give red spot in places with lots of light due to lack of IR filter, which made it incompatible for this case.
- The OpenCV library (in Python3) is used for all the image manipulation and data extrapolation. HSV mode has been used for all the detecting, while images arer displayed in RGB. Sometimes, red may appear as blue due to use of BGR format used by camera to rercord. This is of no consequence, since it does not affect detection itself.
- Initially, the colour ranges for the obstacles, parking walls and side walls are identified. Interestingly, in our case, the 'magenta' parking walls show up as pure red.
- First, the region of interest (ROI) is taken as the bottom half of the feed (this is for our camera placement. May vary for other setups).
- Then, coloured masks (one each for red and green) are applied, followed by OpenCV's controur detection to detect surfaces. Data like position, height and width of the contours may be obtained from the other OpenCV methods.
- If the contours detected meet the required criteria (like size, height-width ratio), they are classified as obstacles. For our benefit, rectangles are drawn around the obstacles.
- Using the data available, including obstacle position, yaw and distance travelled, the required steering is calculated to pass the obstacle on the correct side, when not at a turn (Red - right, green - left)
- When the side chosen is preceded by a turn, the turn is initiated at a predefined distance from the wall ahead. (Ex: Clockwise round, green -> turn early)

Improvements:
1. The RPLidar might have been used effectively with better drivers with the standard Raspbian OS.
2. A more accurate formula to convert y-coordinate of obstacle obtained by the camera into actual distance


# Robot Assembly

# Peripherals Interface Board
![Peripherals Interface Board - Top](https://github.com/pkr2308/Ctrl-Alt-Defeat-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025/blob/main/repo-assets/edited-photos/periph-board-pcb-top.jpg)

The peripherals interface board goes between the Raspberry Pi and vehicle hardware. The board talks to three 1d TFLuna LiDARs, a 9-axis BNO055 IMU, the motor encoder, the drive motor, and the steering servo. It talks to the Pi over USB.

## Hardware
The board is a two-layer, 1.6 mm thick PCB designed in [KiCad](https://kicad.org) and manufactured by [Robu](https://robu.in).
TODO: Expand

## Software
The interface board was programmed in C++, with the C++ SDK from Raspberry Pi for the RP2040 chip. Code was flashed using the PlatformIO extension for the VSCode editor.

The codebase is designed to be modular, with easily swappable drivers for hardware abstraction. Algorithms do not need to know about specific hardware protocols or constraints

`main.cpp` loads in drivers, which implement virtual interface classes. `main.cpp` then initialises everything, and in a loop, gets data from the `SensoorManager`, passes that data to our drive algorithm, and outputs it to the `TargetController`, which commands the motor and steering servo.
Drivers are in `/src/drivers`, Interfaces are in `/src/interfaces/`, and utilities are in `/src/utils/`.

### Code Development Standards
To ensure easily testable, upgradeable, and clean code, a few standards were adhered to when writing code for the interface board.

- `main.cpp` must be as clean as possible.
  - Logic and code flow must be easy to understand.
- All hardware-specific things should be done inside a driver.
- Drivers must take in a standard unit as their input.
  - Drivers must not take in [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)).

TODO: Finish writing this

### Drivers
> [!NOTE]
> Hardware revision 1 drivers are incomplete, as the peripherals baord codebase was partly written when the switch from the prototype interface and the PCB occured, and drivers from that point on were only for the PCB (hardware revision 2).
A list of implemented drivers:
- `hwrev2_imu` : Implements `ISensor`. Driver for the BNO055. Gets orientation data processed by the BNO055's internal microcontroller.
- `hwrev2_lidar` : Implements `ISensor`. Driver for the TFLuna LiDARs. Returns a [0, 259] of distance data. The three LiDARs are mapped to `0`, `90`, and `270`. (This is a remnant of the original plan of connecting the RPLidar to the peripherals board, instead of to the Pi.)
- `hwrev2_motor_driver` : Implements `IMotorDriver`. Driver for the TB6612FNG dual-channel H-bridge motor driver. The driver only supports driving a single channel on the T66612FNG.
- `hwrev2_rf24_communication` :  Implements `ICommunication`. Driver for the nRF24L01+ radio used during development. Transmits vehicle data and gets commands from another nRF24L01+, connected to a computer.
- `hwrev2_single_lidar_open_round` : Implements `IDriveAlgorithm`. A port of our open round test algorithm. The name is misleading, the algorithm uses all three TFLunas.
- `hwrev2_steering_driver` : Implements `ISteeringDriver`. Driver for the MG996 steering servo. Takes in a degree input and coverts it to a 0-180 command with a conversion constant.
- `hwrev2_target_control` : Implements `ITargetControl`. Takes in a `VehicleCommand`, and either passes it directly through to the `ISteeringDriver` and `IMotorDriver`, or passes the command through a PID controller first.
- `hwrev2_uart_logger` :  Implements `ILogger`, Takes in a sender, message type, and a message string
- `hwrev2_vehicle_speed` : Implements `ISensor`. Gets vehicle distance from the motor encoder. Calculates speed using time between pulses.

### Interfaces

Interfaces are virtual classes which define certain functions. Drivers implement these classes. Code calls functions defined in the interface virtual class.

- `IDriveAlgorithm` : Takes in a `VehicleData` object, and returns a `VehicleCommand` object.
- `ILogger` : Constructs a message and prints it out on a UART bus. Takes in a sender string, a log type (information, warning, error) and the message.
- `IMotorDriver` : Takes in a speed value and outputs to a motor driver.
- `ISensor` :  A generic sensor object. Returns a vector of `SensorData` objects.
- `ISteeringDriver` :  Takes in a wheel steering angle, outputs to a steering mechanism.
- `ITargetControl`: Takes in a `VehicleCommand`, outputs to a motor and steering driver.

### Managers

Managers are classes that handle certain aspects of the vehicle. Certain structs have their header files in the `/src/managers` folder, even though they are not classes.

- `VehicleConfig` :  A struct containing information about the vehicle. A `VehicleConfig` struct is passed to all drivers asnd managers.
- `SensorData` :  A struct containing fields for all data that can be collected by the vehicle, and an enum which tells the caller what fields are being used.
- `SensorManager` :  A class which takes in an arbitrary number of sensors, collects data from them, and processes them into a `VehicleData` struct.
- `SensorStatus` :  A (currently unused) enumeration which defines keys for states a sensor can be in. 
- `Vec3f` :  A struct of three double-precisionn floating point numbers, used to represent three-axis values.
- `VehicleCommand` :  A struct defining a target speed and yaw value for the vehicle. Returned by a drive algorithm, passed to a `ITargetController`.
- `VehicleData` :  A struct containing processed vehicle data. Returned by a `SensorManager`.

## Utilities

- `SchedulerTask` : A class which calls a function periodically.
- `Schedular` : A class which takes in an arbitrary number of `SchedulerTask`s, and updates them.


# Raspberry Pi System

The Raspberry Pi system handles most tasks for the obstacle round, including unparking, obstacle detection and navigation.

## Raspbian Setup

We are using Raspbian Bookworm.
Run the following commands in the terminal
- $`sudo chmod 0700 /run/user/1000`
- $`sudo apt install software-properties-common`
- $`sudo apt install python3-launchpadlib`
- $`sudo apt install code`
- $`sudo apt upgrade code`
- $`sudo apt install idle3`
- $`sudo apt install python3-opencv`
- $`sudo apt install -y python3-libcamera python3-pyqt5 python3-picamera2`
- Refer [here](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/UPS_HAT_(E)) to install UPS library to show details about the batteries.
- If the Pi is accidentally shut down, and git is not working, run the following: 
1. $`find .git/objects/ -type f -empty | xargs rm` - Cleaning
2. $`git fetch -p` - Restore missing objects
3. $`git fsck --full` - Verify
- It is advised to have RPiConnect for easy connection to the Pi.
- This reposittory is cloned on the Pi and the obstacle round program is added to the startup sequence.

## Adding Programs to Startup

The method used here involves running executables on startup. Refer [`initial-tests/startup-test/`](https://github.com/pkr2308/Ctrl-Alt-Defeat-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025/tree/main/initial-tests/startup-test) for the code.
1. Create the python file
2. Create a launcher script, like the one in the initial test file, that ends in `.sh`. Ensure the launcher is working with `./(launcher-name).sh` in its directory.
3. In the launcher script, navigate to the directory of the python file and run it with `sudo python3 (file-name).py`. Then return to user directory
4. In the directory with launcher script, make it executable by running `sudo chmod 755 (launcher-name).sh`
5. Run `sudo crontab -e` (you can use nano to edit it), and add `@reboot sh /home/(user)/(path to launcher)/(launcher-name).sh` at the end.
6. Restart the Pi (`sudo reboot`) to check if it works.
 

## PiCamera 3

The Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Wide is used for obstacle detection. It is placed high up to have a good view. (We actually only use the bottom half of the frame!)

## Serial Communication

The Pi communicates with the RP2040 over the serial. When the Pi sends a command (speed and steering), the RP2040 sends back data (like yaw, lidar distance, turn direction etc.)


# Open Round

Refer to `sw/peripherals-board/src/drivers/hwrev2/hwrev2_single_lidar_open_round.cpp and .hpp` files for program.

## Header File

Public includes the logger (for debugging), vehicle command (for driving) and sets direct control of servo (A target yaw value is generally given). Private includes setup of variables for driving, turning, servo, IMU, 1D LiDARs and IMU-based straight follower. 

## Implementation File

### Initialisation
- Sets up logging
- Sets initial speed and steering

### Turn Detection & Execution:
- Uses front LiDAR to detect when to start a turn (if obstacle is close).
- Decides turn direction (left/right) based on side LiDARs (First turn only)
- Turns are started considering factors of distance available, yaw, current section and distance travelled. 
- Adjusts steering (servo position) during turn based on yaw and for greater smoothness.
- After each turn, resets variables and prepares for the next segment. Target yaw and threshold distance may be altered for better accuracy and counter drifting.
- The idea to stick to the outer wall, so even with randomisation, the extended inner wall is not hit

### Straight Movement:
- When not turning, uses gyro (yaw) to follow a straight path.
- Applies proportional-integral correction to steering for accurate straight-line travel.

### Turn Direction Logic:
- Chooses clockwise or anticlockwise based on which side has more open space (LiDAR difference).
- Sets different thresholds for smoother turns depending on direction.

### Stopping 
- Counts turns; after 12 turns (3 rounds), slows down and stops at the start section.

## Flow
1. Start moving straight.
2. Decide turn direction using side LiDARs. (For first turn only)
3. Detect distance to wall ahead with front LiDAR.
4. Execute turn when condition are met, adjust steering and target yaw.
5. After turn, resume straight movement with PI control.
6. Repeat for 3 rounds (12 turns).
7. After final round, slow down and stop in the start section.
